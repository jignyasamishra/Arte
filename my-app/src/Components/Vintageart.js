 the Gospels, including Matthew ,in which Jesus declares that one of the Apostles will betray him and later institutes the Eucharist. According to Leonardo’s belief that posture, gesture, 
 and expression should manifest the “notions of the mind,” each one of the 12 disciples reacts in a manner that Leonardo considered fit for that man’s personality.

<div  style={{fontSize:"25px",width:"70%",position:"relative",left:"100px",bottom:"15px"}}>Militia Company of District II under the Command of Captain Frans Banninck Cocq, also known as The Shooting Company of Frans Banning Cocq and Willem van Ruytenburch, 
but commonly referred to as The Night Watch , is a 1642 painting by Rembrandt van Rijn. It is in the collection of the Amsterdam Museum but is prominently displayed in the Rijksmuseum as the best-known painting in its collection. 
The Night Watch is one of the most famous Dutch Golden Age paintings.

The painting is famous for three things: its colossal size, the dramatic use of light and shadow and the perception of motion in what would have traditionally been a static military group portrait.
 The painting was completed in 1642, at the peak of the Dutch Golden Age. </div>
